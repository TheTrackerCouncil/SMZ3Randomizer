# Keysanity SM Notes

Currently implemented are three types of key card doors.
Level 1, Level 2 and Boss

Getting a keycards for the specific area and level will unlock all doors tagged with that key level.

## Crateria
   Has three keys and not too much to block here and it needs to be quite open to allow passage to other areas.
  
   ### Level 1
   Locks the gauntlet + Crateria PB's + (Maybe Crateria Supers)

   ### Level 2
   Locks the access to moat. The idea is to block the "main" entrance to WS while allowing the back door
   from Maridia to stay open through other means. Could lead to interesting routing hopefully.

   ### Boss
   Locks access to Bomb Torizo which is I guess Crateria's Boss :)

## Brinstar
   Three keys, also very much a main hub area in places where locking down access might be troublesome.

   ### Level 1
   Blue brin right side

   ### Level 2
   Etecoons + connecting rooms to Pink brinstar

   ### Boss
   Kraid, enough said

## Norfair
   Three keys, not sure what to do here

   ### Level 1
   Green door to ice beam

   ### Level 2
   Bubble mountain access

   ### Boss
   Crocomire's area? Since we have a separate key for LN
   
## Maridia
   Three keys, not sure what to do here

   ### Level 1
   Blocking the room after mount everest from both sides + aqueduct save

   ### Level 2
   Key into botwoon, and from other side into e-tank room after botwoon

   ### Boss
   Draygon

## Wrecked Ship
   Two keys allocated, not sure if having two makes sense and one might be enough

   ### Level 1
   Bowling Alley + Reserve check door

   ### Boss
   Phantoon

## Lower Norfair
   Two keys, one which is Ridley ofcourse

   ### Level 1
   Access past Writg? Would allow "West side LN" without a key for acess to Mire portal

   ### Boss
   Ridley
