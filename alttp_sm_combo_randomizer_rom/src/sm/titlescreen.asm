; Spritemap format is roughly:
;     nnnn         ; Number of entries (2 bytes)
;     xxxx yy attt ; Entry 0 (5 bytes)
;     ...          ; Entry 1...
; Where:
;     n = number of entries
;     x = X offset of sprite from centre
;     y = Y offset of sprite from centre
;     a = attributes
;     t = tile number

; More specifically, a spritemap entry is:
;     s000000xxxxxxxxx yyyyyyyy YXpp000ttttttttt
; Where:
;     s = size bit
;     x = X offset of sprite from centre
;     y = Y offset of sprite from centre
;     Y = Y flip
;     X = X flip
;     p = priority (relative to background)
;     t = tile number
