# the information in this file. Supplying a custom file, however, allows for mime-types and
# internationalisation. If supplied, the file MUST contain the line: 'Exec=${INSTALL_EXEC}'
# in order to use the correct install location. Other macros may be used to help automate the content.

# 'helloworld'. It must not contain spaces or invalid filename characters. Do not add any extension such
# as '.exe'. If empty, the application will not be in the path and cannot be started from the command line.

# '-p:DebugType=None -p:DebugSymbols=false -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishReadyToRun=true
